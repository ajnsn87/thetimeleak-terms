Effective Date: [September 22, 2024]

At TheTimeLeak, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you interact with our services, including our website and Twitter account.

1. Information We Collect

TheTimeLeak does not collect any personal information directly. However, we may receive data through third-party services, such as Twitter, when you engage with our content.

	•	Twitter Data: When you interact with our Twitter account (e.g., following, liking, retweeting, or replying), Twitter may provide us with certain information about you based on their privacy policy. This may include your username, profile information, and public interactions.

2. How We Use Your Information
